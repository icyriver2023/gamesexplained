Gitignored. Everything here is either the contributor's own copy of the
game or derived from it: the image, extracted program files, emulator
snapshots, the disassembler's project file, the annotation log. Nothing in
this folder is ever committed or uploaded.

To rebuild it from your own copy of the game, follow `../orientation.md`,
then `python3 kit/scripts/symbols_import.py <this game> <your snapshot>`
to recreate the disassembler project with all annotations. The snapshot's
extension is the platform's own — a `.vsf` on the Commodore 64, a `.sna`
on the ZX Spectrum — and `../orientation.md` names the file this game used.

Found this folder already here, left by an earlier session? It is a
cache, not a record. `kit/START.md`, on a game folder that already
exists, says what to keep from it and how to check it.
