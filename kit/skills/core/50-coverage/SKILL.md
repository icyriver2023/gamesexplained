# Measure comprehension, not disassembly

Record your model id in `game.json` under `step_models`, as `"50-coverage": ["<your model id>"]`, exactly as your session names it, and add any model that takes the step over from you: `models.py` reads it to decide whether this game proves the model or needs a maintainer's check (`kit/CHECKING.md`). The largest run to 19 September 2026: 24 KB to 100 % in about forty minutes with nine agents on disjoint ranges. One agent is several times slower per kilobyte.

Disassembly coverage flatters you. Bytes can be decoded, labelled, even
commented nearby, and still understood by nobody. The shared metric
(`kit/scripts/coverage.py`) counts a byte as explained only when the
symbol that owns it carries a prose description. Every game is scored the
same way, so tiers mean the same thing everywhere.

## The loop

1. `python3 kit/scripts/coverage.py games/<platform>/<slug> --live`
   prints the figure and the work queue: the largest contiguous
   undescribed runs, largest first.
2. Take the top of the queue. Read the routine or table. Work out what it
   does in terms of the game (what the player sees, which feature in
   `features.md` it serves). Name it. Write a **line comment on its entry
   address** that describes the whole thing: purpose, inputs, outputs,
   side effects, which tables it reads. While it is in front of you, note
   anything it would accept that the player was never meant to do: an
   exact match where a range was meant, a comparison that assumes a sign,
   an eight-bit sum that can wrap, a test whose order leaves a gap. Put
   the note in `facts.md` as an open question; `60-verify` says how to
   settle it and `70-minisite` what to make of it.
3. Update `features.md` statuses and `facts.md` as facts firm up.
4. Every 30 minutes or so, and at the end of every session:
   `python3 kit/scripts/symbols_export.py games/<platform>/<slug>`, then
   `python3 kit/scripts/listing.py games/<platform>/<slug> work/<state>.<snapshot ext>`
   (the platform's snapshot extension: a `.vsf` on the C64, a `.sna` on the
   ZX Spectrum; `kit/skills/<platform>/` names it)
   so the committed listing never drifts from the symbols.
   A later session that has neither the snapshot nor the disassembler
   project (a hosted one starts in a fresh container) can still correct a
   comment or rename a label: edit `symbols.json` by hand, then
   `python3 kit/scripts/listing.py games/<platform>/<slug> --recomment`.
   It changes only the listing's comments and names, and refuses anything
   more (a block, a symbol's address or type, a comment added or removed).
   The project still holds the old text, and its next export would put it
   back, so name each hand edit in `TODO.md` for whoever holds the project
   to carry into it.
5. Repeat until the tier you are aiming for is met.

### When the disassembler does not follow control flow

Where the disassembler walks the code and mints a symbol at every branch
target, the coverage queue is populated for you. Where the annotation
surface is instead a **control file** - typed blocks the disassembler obeys
rather than derives - nothing separates the code from the data for you, and
it has to be done before the loop above can start. A wrong split does not
show afterwards: code typed as data has no cross-references, reads as a
table and is described as one, and coverage still reaches 100 %. The first
such game was published for review with 5.9 KB of its code typed as data.

Two sources, used together:

- **The emulator's executed-address map**: every address the CPU executed
  while you drove the game through the states you could reach (each menu,
  each control, losing, giving up). It finds the code that runs, including
  what only a computed jump reaches.
- **A recursive trace**: decode from every address the map gives, and from
  the entries the map cannot contain (code that ran before the snapshot was
  taken, a handler whose address is only stored in data, an operand another
  instruction writes), follow every branch and call target, repeat. It adds
  the code a static walk can reach that the recorded play never ran.

Everything neither found is data, unless a reference says a routine reads it
as a table.

**Iterate, because a wrong type hides what it calls.** A walk decodes only
what it is given, so a stretch filed as data also hides the routines *it*
calls, and the map sweep on its own will report that stretch as data too.
Repeat the sweep until a pass adds nothing, then believe the total. A single
pass under-reports, and the difference is not a rounding error: see the entry
in `kit/lessons/` for the run that measured both.

**Let a script hold the typing against the map**, and run it again after
every merge of the annotation agents' work. The platform's tool skills say
which commands produce the map, how to turn it into the control file's
format, how to check the result against it, and how to read it back
(`kit/skills/<platform>/`).

## Rules that keep the number honest

- **A description belongs to a routine, not to every branch target inside
  it.** The disassembler mints an automatic label at each jump target;
  comment the entry, not each label.
- **A blank comment explains nothing.** Only non-blank line comments
  count.
- **Decide "routine" by the bytes, not the symbol type.** A renamed jump
  target that starts a routine is a routine.
- **Name what is drawn from its picture, not from its handler.** Several
  kinds of one thing (the shots, the pick-ups, the special bubbles) have
  handlers that differ by a step size or a turn, and the movement reads
  as any of them. Before naming a kind, follow its draw routine to the
  picture it shows and its colour, and render the picture
  (`20-features`, "Picture reference"). One run named its water as
  lightning and its fire as water from the handlers alone, and corrected
  thirty comments when the pictures were drawn.
- **False symbols exist.** The skip idiom (a two-byte or three-byte opcode
  used to skip the next instruction) makes the disassembler mint a symbol
  for an "address" that is really an operand. Explain it as such rather
  than inventing a meaning for the address.
- **Resolve every pointer table before excluding a region.** A relocating
  init can leave a block that looks like a stale copy of somewhere else;
  one run excluded 8 KB as "the leftover of the copy at $3E00" and it held
  all 224 shape scripts, which the pointer tables at $9600/$9700 named
  byte for byte. Before a region goes in `exclude`, take every table the
  code indexes as an address (lo/hi pairs, split lo/hi tables) and check
  where its entries land. If any land in the region, it is data.
- **An unpacked load can run on past its own data.** An unpacker that
  stops at the end of its read window, or on a count, goes on decoding
  whatever follows its stream (the next file's packed bytes, a sector's
  filler) with this load's table, and writes the result after the real
  data, where it looks like more of the same. Find where the stream ends:
  trace the unpacker and count what it takes, or compare the same file
  loaded from two disks or sides, which agree on the data and can differ
  after it. Exclude the rest, with that reason, once nothing reads it.
- **A comment a program writes is one claim made for every record.**
  Level data of a known format is quickest described by a script that
  writes each record's comment from templates. Before it writes, test
  each sentence a template produces against the code on every path that
  reads the field: a flag can change which routine reads it, when that
  runs, or whether anything does, and a sentence written from the
  commonest case is wrong for every other. Make the template choose its
  sentence from the record's own bytes (`60-verify` says how such
  comments are sampled).
- **Runtime state is excluded** from the denominator: stack, screen
  memory, I/O. Authored data nothing references by address (a character
  set, a packed string block) is **added** through the `coverage` object
  in `game.json`. Get these two lists right early; they decide what 100 %
  means for this game.
- **A game can live under its I/O.** A game that banks the I/O chips out
  can run code and keep tables in the RAM beneath them, which the platform
  default excludes as I/O. Look for code in a register census of the traced
  code (instructions *located* in the I/O range) and for the bank switch
  around them; then give the range back with `coverage.include` in
  `game.json`. The disassembler will name those addresses after the chips'
  registers, so say in each comment which meaning is live.
  An address there has one label but two meanings, and each instruction
  sees one of them. `listing.py` names an operand there after the chip's
  register when the instruction lies outside the range, and after the
  game's symbol when it lies inside, since code there can only run with
  the chips banked out; a jump or a call always gets the code's symbol.
  That rule is wrong for code elsewhere that banks the chips out and
  reads or writes the RAM beneath, so go through every bank switch and
  list those instructions in `game.json` under `io`, one row per stretch,
  `["$B275", "$B2F0", "ram", "banked out from $B273 to $B2F1"]` (`registers`
  for code in the range that banks the chips back in; the last row that
  holds the instruction decides). `listing.py <game dir> --relabel` puts a
  change to `io` into `listing.json` without the snapshot. An instruction
  reached both ways keeps one name; say the other in its comment.
  A game can also keep graphics there without banking anything, for the
  video chip alone (on the C64, `c64-reference`, "RAM the CPU cannot
  see"); `listing.py` names that RAM whenever it holds data and
  `game.json` has not said what it is (below).
- **Is the picture loaded or drawn?** Compare a snapshot taken before the
  game's first instruction (the loader's hand-over) with one in play. A
  screen or bitmap that is already there before the game runs is authored
  data, to be described; one the game builds is output, to be excluded.
  A plane can contain both. Declare its complete authored extent, then
  exclude only the generated cells or rows. `coverage.include` overrides
  custom exclusions as well as platform defaults: a broad include of the
  whole plane gives the output back. Include only its authored gaps when
  the plane sits under a platform exclusion. Re-run the loaded-data audit
  after changing the scope or recovering code: new operand references can
  split an already described allocation into undescribed aliases.
- **Never bulk-disassemble every labelled address** to "recover"
  coverage. Many labels sit on data; disassembling them misclassifies the
  bytes as code. Undo by setting the data type back to undefined.
- **A gap can hold a different record type.** A frame directory can point
  to a short sprite descriptor followed by animation commands before the
  next frame. Check every other directory and constant pointer load before
  calling the gap unused. Parse the candidate format through its actual
  end and establish a consumer or a live execution check. A spare tuple
  after a counted record can also be a retained extra component: describe
  the read limit and keep its purpose open rather than guessing padding.
- **Reading a region may disassemble it as a side effect** in some
  disassemblers. Log an explicit disassemble entry for every new code
  region you explore, or a replay under-restores.
- **Know how far a description reaches.** In `kit/scripts/ledger.py` a
  symbol owns the bytes from itself to the next boundary symbol, capped at
  1024 bytes for code, for symbols you create yourself and for a symbol
  the disassembler made that you have renamed inside a typed data block
  (bytes, words, text, pointers), and at 64 bytes for any other data
  symbol: one you renamed in memory left undefined keeps the cap, so that
  a renamed variable does not take in the bytes after it. Block boundaries
  cut a span too. A data span also stops at the fixed edges of the memory
  map, `$0100`, `$0200`, `$0400`, `$0800`, `$1000`, `$4000`, `$8000`,
  `$A000`, `$C000`, `$D000` and `$E000`: a table that runs across one of
  them needs a second symbol there, with a comment saying where the whole
  starts. A routine runs on across them. A data table of a few hundred
  bytes under a 64-byte symbol therefore needs a data type and a name of
  your own, or a named symbol every 64 bytes or less, each with its own
  description,
  or most of it stays out of the count however well you have explained
  the whole.

## A game of several parts

Each part (`10-orient`, "A game of several parts") has a ledger of its
own: give `coverage.py`, `symbols_export.py` and `listing.py` the part's
folder. The game's figure is the sum, `coverage.py <game dir>`, and it
counts each byte once, because each byte has one owner: a part that lies
over another counts only its `"ranges"`, and the part beneath does not
count them, unless they fall in ranges of its own (its snapshot holds its
own bytes there). 100 % means every part the game has a folder for. A part
with a folder and no analysis is not in the figure, and the page says so
beside it.

A part that lies over another is annotated in one session with it: the
snapshot holds both. `symbols_import.py <part> <snapshot>` puts the
names of the part beneath into the session, so the code the part calls
is readable. Export each part's share from that session:

```
python3 kit/scripts/symbols_export.py games/<platform>/<slug>/parts/<level>
python3 kit/scripts/symbols_export.py games/<platform>/<slug>/parts/<engine> --from games/<platform>/<slug>/parts/<level>
```

The export says when the session holds a label or a comment of yours at
an address the part does not own and no other part has it: export the
part that owns it, or it is lost. Build the listing of the part beneath
from any snapshot that holds it, and of each part over it from that
part's own. `listing.py` names what the part calls by the names of the
part beneath, and `check_listing.py` says when one of those has changed
(`listing.py <part> --relabel`, no snapshot needed).

The session traces the code of the part beneath as well, and where that
code refers to an address in this part's ranges the disassembler mints an
automatic symbol there, which the export keeps as this part's. It names an
address this part's own code may never use, and it can hold the figure
down. Look for automatic symbols in the part's ranges whose every
cross-reference comes from outside them, and delete each (a temporary
name, then an empty one); a rebuilt session mints them again. <!-- until #213 -->

## Data the ledger cannot see

The ledger counts what code, symbols and `game.json` name. Data that
nothing refers to by address is outside the count altogether, neither
explained nor bare, so the work queue never shows it and a game can reach
100 % without it: sprite shapes found through pointers, a picture's
colours, the words of an inline table after a call, the tail of a table
past its symbol's reach, and anything under a default exclusion.

`listing.py` lists it after every build. It names the RAM a platform
default excludes but a game can still use (on the C64, the RAM under the
I/O area) whenever that RAM holds data and `game.json` has not said what
it is. With the hand-over snapshot, `work/entry.<ext>` (`10-orient`; the
extension is the platform's snapshot form, from `PLATFORM_DEFAULTS`), it
also lists every stretch of loaded data, the same bytes at the hand-over
and in play, that the ledger neither tracks nor has been told to leave
out. When the listing is built from the hand-over itself (the start-up
code exists nowhere else), give it the play snapshot as the second image:
`--entry work/<play>.<ext>`. Before calling 100 %, go through that list and say what each stretch
is: label and describe it, or list it in `game.json` under
`coverage.extra` (authored data), `coverage.include` (RAM under a default
exclusion) or `coverage.exclude` (not the game's, with the reason). One
game reached 100 % with 1.6 KB of its own tables and its picture's
colours outside the count.

Data the start-up copies elsewhere (out of the way of the I/O area, under
a ROM, into another bank) differs between the images at its own address,
so the list also looks for it at another: an untracked stretch of 32
bytes or more in play that the hand-over holds somewhere else is listed
with both addresses ("copied here after the hand-over"). One game reached
100 % with half a kilobyte of moved graphics outside every span before
the list did this. A copy the start-up changes on the way (unpacked,
shifted, interleaved, or built from pieces) matches nowhere, so follow
the start-up's copy loops to their destinations as well, and check each
against the ledger.

## Interpreted programs and code loaded as level data

If a CPU trace reaches an interpreter or calls into a loaded level,
follow the program it dispatches too. Read [compiled-programs.md](compiled-programs.md)
for operand decoding, branch checks and separate loaded-image meanings.

## Inline parameters: the reason a flow disassembler stalls

When control-flow disassembly reaches a few thousand bytes and stops, and a
scan of every `jsr`/`jmp` target inside the code it did find turns up
nothing new, the rest is not all data. Look for a routine that pulls its
own return address off the stack:

```
    pla / sta ptr / pla / sta ptr+1     ; the return address
    ... read a word through (ptr) ...
    inc ptr / inc ptr                   ; step past it
    jmp (ptr)                           ; resume after the argument
```

A call to that routine is followed by an **argument**, not an instruction,
and the disassembler walks straight into it, decodes it as code and shifts
everything after it. Find every call site of every such routine, type the
argument bytes as data, and restart the disassembly at the resume point.
One pass of this can double the tracked image.

The same shape hides more than one routine: look for a family of wrappers
built on one or two stack-unwinding primitives, and check each for the
number of inline bytes it eats, which need not be the same.

### Inline jump tables that never come back

A variant has no resume point: an "on n go to". The routine pulls its
return address, picks the n-th word of the table that follows the call,
pushes it and executes `RTS`, so each word is a handler's address **minus
one** and control never returns to the call site. A state-machine game
can have a hundred such tables, one per behaviour, and flow tracing stalls
at every one of them.

- Find every call to the routine (and to each entry that loads n from a
  different place first) with a byte scan of the whole image, not just the
  traced code.
- The table's length is not stored. It ends where the next call site
  begins, at a handler that nearly every table ends with, or at the first
  word whose target (word + 1) is not code. When testing a target, accept
  a handler that itself opens with a call to the switch: its own table
  follows at once, so it will not decode as three clean instructions.
- Type each table as words, then disassemble every target. **Never
  disassemble a call site afterwards:** the tracer assumes the call
  returns, walks into the table again and turns it back into code.
- One of the tables may select the behaviour itself (a behaviour number
  indexing a long table of other call sites). Check its length against the
  values the variable takes live; a parse that stopped at the first odd
  entry can be a quarter of the real table.

### Calls whose target is written at run time

A raster interrupt that runs a different routine in each band of the
screen often does it with one `JSR` whose operand it rewrites from a
display list, and a music driver may dispatch its command bytes through
`JMP (table)` with an operand it computes. The tracer reaches none of the
targets. Find what writes the operand, parse every table it reads (and
every table of such tables), and seed the tracer with each entry, checking
that it lands on code; an entry pointing at data is an unused slot. One
game gained 4.5 KB of code from its display lists and 1 KB from its
music driver's three dispatch tables this way. Such an operand is often
assembled as `$0000`, which sends the tracer into zero page
(`tool-regen2000`).

**Reaching 100 % is a correctness pass, not a formality.** Writing a
precise description of every routine forces re-reading code that was
"already understood", and that is where confident wrong claims get
caught: names kept from a first hypothesis, table lengths read past their
end, a mechanic adopted from documentation instead of from the code.

macOS has no `timeout` command (`kit/INSTALL.md` says so, and this is
where the temptation to reach for it is strongest). A long live probe
needs a guard inside the script or a background run you poll.

## Splitting the work across subagents

**One agent is the default.** Every agent starts cold: it reads the
brief, the game's notes and its neighbours' code before it writes
anything, so tokens grow with the number of agents, not with the game.
The record bears it out. Single agents took 20 to 22 KB of code to
100 % in 30 to 40 minutes; runs of seven to twelve agents took 14 to 62
minutes and then spent the difference on merging, naming collisions and
reconciling reports in `60-verify`. Two nine-agent runs used up the
account's session limit within minutes and sat idle for hours. Fanning
out bought no quality either: what caught wrong readings was checking by
an agent that did not write them, not parallel writing.

Split only when one of these holds, and the contributor's answer about
their usage limit (`kit/START.md`) allows it:

- **The game is several parts**: one agent to a part (below).
- **What is left after your own first pass is too much for one
  context**: as a guide, more than about 32 KB of code still undescribed.

Annotate first yourself, then split. Take the main loop, the interrupt
handlers, the core variables and the naming conventions to described
before anyone else starts: the brief's "Established" list is then short
and checked, and the agents inherit names instead of inventing rival
ones. Start at most four agents, and fewer on a tight limit. When you
do split, what matters:

- **One shared disassembler.** Concurrent reads are safe; concurrent
  writes are safe only if agents own **disjoint address ranges**. Assign
  them explicitly and say so in each prompt.
- **One log per agent.** Parallel appends to one file interleave. Give
  each agent its own `work/annotations-<n>.jsonl`, merge afterwards.
- **One scratch folder per agent**, `work/agent<n>/`, named in its prompt.
  Agents write helper scripts, and they reach for the same obvious names
  (`refs.py`, `state.py`): in a shared folder one agent's helper
  overwrites another's halfway through its work.
- **Ask for the report in a file as well**, `work/reports/agent<n>.md`.
  The final message is all the lead sees, and it can be lost from the
  lead's context before the facts are merged.
- **Export every ten minutes while agents write.** A crash of the shared
  disassembler costs every agent's work since the last export;
  `symbols_import.py` rebuilds the session from that export (the tool
  skill). Restart the emulator alone (`tools.py stop vice`). A bare
  `tools.py stop` leaves the disassembler up while its logs are newer
  than the export, and says so; `--force` is for a session you mean to
  lose.
- **One figure per agent.** `coverage.py <game> --live --range $2000 $27FF`
  prints the figure and the work queue for one agent's range alone; the
  whole-image queue is mostly other agents' work.
- Agents read into neighbours' ranges for context; ranges prevent write
  collisions, not two agents naming the same thing. Catch that when
  merging.
- **Find the loaded data before you split the image.** Go through the
  list in "Data the ledger cannot see" before choosing the ranges, not
  only before calling 100 %. One game's agents finished with 16 KB of map
  and sprite images still outside the count, left for the lead alone;
  found first, they are a range in a brief.
- Brief them cold, from `brief.md` beside this file: copy it to the
  game's `work/BRIEF.md` and fill it in. It asks for the feature list,
  `facts.md` so far, the rules above, the exact client command with each
  agent's own log, and the report you want back.
- **A brief carries only what has been checked**: each fact under
  "Established" names its evidence, and the rest goes under "Guesses"
  (the template's opening comment says why).
- Force the model explicitly. Spot-check one claim per agent against the
  source before believing the report.
- **A game of several parts splits by part before it splits by range**:
  one agent to a part, each with a disassembler of its own on that
  part's snapshot. The platform's tool notes say how several run at
  once. Give each agent its part's folder, and have every command name
  it: a command that names no folder reaches whichever session the clone
  started last, and an export from the wrong session writes one part's
  names into another's map.
- **An agent stopped by the account's usage limit keeps its context.**
  Nine agents at once use up a session's allowance quickly; when they
  stop on the limit, export at once, wait for the reset and resume each
  agent with a message (the harness's resume, not a new agent), telling
  it what is already in the disassembler. A new agent rereads its range
  from nothing.
- **An account that pays by credit can fail every agent at its first
  call**, and on every retry: one run's four agents got
  `402 payment_required` because the runner asked for 128,000 tokens the
  balance could not cover, and one also met the account's cap on
  requests in flight, below five. Before a fan-out on such an account,
  check the balance, start fewer agents, and lower the runner's
  `max_tokens` where it has the setting. An agent that failed at its
  first call left nothing to resume.
- **Correct the brief the moment a fact in it turns out wrong**, and say
  in it that it was corrected. Agents still running read the old line;
  their reports will contradict it, which is how one run found that its
  "Established" control had been read off a snapshot taken mid-jump.

## Declare what the bytes are

The About tab draws the game's footprint in the 64 KB space (on the
Spectrum, the 48 KB of RAM above the ROM) and counts code, graphics,
level data, sound, text, tables and variables. The build classifies
from the listing (code, text, data), the video bases in
`game.json` (the character set) and symbol-name hints (`str_`, `tune_`,
`sprite`, `maze`, and the like). Anything larger than a few bytes that
those cannot see, declare in `game.json` under `regions`:

```
"regions": [["$80A1", "$8A8A", "graphics", "seventy-five shape bitmaps"],
            ["$EEB8", "$F253", "levels", "the four terrain streams"]]
```

Kinds: `code`, `graphics`, `levels`, `sound`, `text`, `tables`,
`variables`. Declared regions win over every other rule.

## Outputs

`symbols.json` current; `facts.md` and `features.md` current; the coverage
figure and the remaining queue in `TODO.md`.
