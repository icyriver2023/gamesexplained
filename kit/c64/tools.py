"""The Commodore 64 launcher: start, check and stop the emulator and the disassembler, all inside this repository.

Reached through `python3 kit/scripts/tools.py`, which picks the platform; do not run this file directly.

Everything the kit installs lives under tools/ (gitignored):
  tools/vice-mcp/    the emulator build, unpacked from the upstream release (`tools.py get-vice`),
                     or a link to a build (`get-vice build`, or `use-vice <dir>` for one of your own)
  tools/src/         vice-mcp source and its build, when built here
  tools/vice-home/   the emulator's config, log and snapshots (XDG paths pointed here)
  tools/r2000-home/  the disassembler's settings, where it follows the XDG paths (Linux)
  tools/cargo/bin/   the disassembler, from `cargo install --root tools/cargo regenerator2000`
  tools/logs/        terminal logs of both
Deleting the repository removes all of it. See kit/c64/INSTALL.md, "Uninstall".

Usage:
  tools.py status
  tools.py vice [x64sc]            start the emulator with its MCP server on 127.0.0.1:6510
                                   (or $KIT_VICE_PORT, when something else holds 6510)
  tools.py r2000 <file>            start the disassembler's MCP server on :3000 on a .vsf/.prg/project
                                   (or $KIT_R2000_PORT, when something else holds 3000: a .vsf or a
                                   project then, served through kit/c64/stdio_bridge.py).
                                   A file in the folder of one part of a game (kit/scripts/parts.py)
                                   gets a port of that part's own, the first free from 3000, kept in
                                   the part's work/r2000-port: each part can have one running, and
                                   every script given the part's folder reaches the right one
  tools.py stop [vice|r2000|all] [--force]
                                   the disassembler stays up while an annotation log written since
                                   it started is newer than the game's symbols.json: export first,
                                   or --force
  tools.py stop r2000 <folder> [--force]
                                   only the disassembler started on a file in that game's or part's
                                   folder; the others of this clone keep running
  tools.py get-vice [download|build]   the newest vice-mcp for this machine; plain, it only says what that is (kit/c64/get_vice.py)
  tools.py use-vice <dir>          use a vice-mcp build of your own: link tools/vice-mcp to it
  tools.py use-vice release        go back to the release (kept at tools/vice-mcp-release)
  tools.py check-emulator          test the emulator against kit/EMULATOR.md (kit/c64/check_emulator.py)
  tools.py build-vice <src dir>    build a vice-mcp source tree into <src dir>/install and use it (kit/c64/build_vice.py)
  tools.py ghidra-fixture <installation>  regenerate the synthetic Ghidra importer fixture
  tools.py snapshots               where emulator snapshots are, and what is there
  tools.py verify-footprint        prove the tools write nothing outside this repository

verify-footprint is how the clean-footprint principle (AGENTS.md, kit/INSTALL.md) is
checked on any operating system: it starts the emulator, makes it write a snapshot,
stops it, and then lists every file outside the repository that changed meanwhile and
looks like it belongs to one of the tools. An empty list is the pass.
